dkjoyprg3.tap - alternative programmer for DK'Tronics programmable joystick interface made in Boriel BASIC. 48K only, OTLA-ing works on real hardware (but somehow fails in Fuse).  
Extensively tested on my perfboard variant of said interface based on this schematic (used 2114 SRAMs instead of 6116): https://hardware.speccy.org/hardware/JoystickProgramable-dktronics/esquemas-i.html
